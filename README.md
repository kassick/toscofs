# Tosco File System -- Single Directory

Reference Implementation of a flat file system. This code was produced for an Operating Systems course and presented to the students.

It supports a flat file system (no sub-directories) for small files. The assignment had these limitations in order to simplify the storage of directories' and files' inodes (all should fit in a single 4K block).
